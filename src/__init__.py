Fairness Framework for Machine Learning

An automated framework for fairness detection and bias mitigation in machine
learning systems with regulatory compliance (EEOC/ECOA).

Modules:
    - fairness_detector: Main detector class for bias detection
    - metrics: Fairness metrics and calculations
    - visualization: Plotting and reporting utilities
    - utils: General utility functions

Example:
    >>> from src.fairness_detector import FairnessDetector
    >>> detector = FairnessDetector()
    >>> results = detector.detect_bias(data)
