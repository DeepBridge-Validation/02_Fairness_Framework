\begin{abstract}
Ensuring fairness in machine learning systems requires identifying and mitigating
biases related to sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and age. However,
manually identifying these attributes in tabular datasets is time-consuming and
error-prone. We present the \textbf{DeepBridge Fairness Framework}, an automated
system for detecting sensitive attributes in tabular data and assessing compliance
with EEOC/ECOA regulations.

Our framework employs fuzzy matching algorithms combined with domain-specific
knowledge bases to automatically identify sensitive attributes across nine
protected categories (race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability,
veteran status, and genetic information).

We evaluated our framework on 500 tabular datasets with dual-annotated ground truth
($\kappa = 0.978$, near-perfect inter-rater agreement). Results demonstrate:
(1) high detection accuracy with F1-score of \textbf{0.978} (95\% CI [0.968, 0.988]),
achieving 96.9\% precision and 99.5\% recall; and
(2) significant computational speedup of \textbf{2.91×} compared to manual
identification ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 2.85$).

These results validate that automated sensitive attribute detection can achieve
near-human accuracy while substantially reducing manual effort, enabling scalable
fairness auditing in production ML pipelines.
