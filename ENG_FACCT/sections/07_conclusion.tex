\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Production ML systems in regulated domains require fairness verification that bridges academic research and regulatory compliance. Existing tools present critical gaps: fragmented metrics, manual attribute identification, absence of regulatory verification, and no threshold optimization guidance.

We presented DeepBridge Fairness, a production-ready framework integrating 15 fairness metrics with automated EEOC/ECOA compliance verification. Through automatic sensitive attribute detection (F1=0.978), threshold optimization, and audit-ready reporting, DeepBridge reduces analysis time by 73\% while detecting violations with 100\% precision. Evaluation across 4 case studies and usability study (N=20, SUS=85.2) demonstrates production readiness.

\textbf{Future work} includes extending to causal fairness definitions, intersectional analysis beyond binary demographics, integration with ML explainability tools, real-time monitoring dashboards, and certification frameworks for regulated industries.

DeepBridge Fairness is in production at financial and healthcare organizations, is open-source under MIT license at [Anonymous repository - link provided upon acceptance].
